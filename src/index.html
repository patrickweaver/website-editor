    <p>
      You can update this website in your browser when viewing it as a local
      file. Here is some text from Don Quixote long enough to wrap so that it is
      easy to see the width of the body element: In a village of La Mancha, the
      name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since
      one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old
      buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more
      beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on
      Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with
      three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went in a doublet of fine
      cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for holidays, while on
      week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun. He had in his house
      a housekeeper past forty, a niece under twenty, and a lad for the field
      and market-place, who used to saddle the hack as well as handle the
      bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he
      was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and a
      great sportsman. They will have it his surname was Quixada or Quesada (for
      here there is some difference of opinion among the authors who write on
      the subject), although from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he
      was called Quexana. This, however, is of but little importance to our
      tale; it will be enough not to stray a hairâ€™s breadth from the truth in
      the telling of it.
